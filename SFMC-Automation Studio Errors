SQL Query Activity Errors

Error Text	Meaning	Suggested Action
Query definition doesn’t exist.	The query was deleted.	Recreate the SQL Query activity.
Query failed during execution. Error: Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint. Can’t insert duplicate key in object '{{DE name}}'. The duplicate key value is (123456789).	The query source doesn’t have a primary key, but the destination does, so the query results in a duplicate record.	Add a primary key field in the source or remove the primary key from the destination.

If this timeout error doesn’t typically occur, retry the activity or automation that it's part of.
If this error recurs, see Salesforce Help: Optimize the Query Activity.

Query failed during execution. Error: String or binary data would be truncated.	The query source has a longer field length than the destination field.	Increase the destination field length so that it allows the same number of characters.

Automatically Deactivated Automations

When an automation fails repeatedly over an extended time period, the automation is deactivated to improve system stability and performance. When an automation is deactivated, you receive an email notification to the email address entered in the automation’s Notification Settings > Runtime Error or Skipped Run box. An inactive automation can’t run again until it’s fixed and reactivated. This feature is turned on for all accounts and can’t be turned off.
